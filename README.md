# Decision-Tree Algorithm based on EEG and EMG signals
## Basic setup:
EEG and EMG electrodes were connected to flexible recording cables via a mini-connector. Recordings started after 20-30 min of habituation. The signals were recorded with an OpenEphys data acquisiton module (sampling rate, 1,000 Hz). You can also record the trigger signal (as reference for treatment or photo-stimulation) and EEG state can be analyzed aligned with the onset of trigger.
## Feature extraction
- EEG and EMG spectral analysis was carried out using fast Fourier transform (FFT). The power spectrum was calculated using 5 s sliding windows, sequentially shifted by 2.5 s increments. 
- We summed the EEG power in the range from 1 to 4 Hz and from 6 to 12 Hz, yielding time-dependent delta and theta power, respectively. For further analysis, we computed the theta/delta power ratio and summed the EMG power in the range of 20-300 Hz. 
## Auto-scoring
- According to the distribution of the EEG delta power (with 24h continuously recording), we determined a threshold for the delta power (delta threshold), separating the typically bimodal distribution of the delta power into a lower and higher range.
- A state was assigned as NREM sleep if the delta power was larger than the delta threshold and if the EMG power was one standard deviation lower than its mean. 
- A state was classified as REM if (1) the delta power was lower than the delta threshold, (2) the theta/delta ratio was higher than one standard
deviation above the mean, and (3) the EMG power was lower than its mean plus one standard deviation. 
- All remaining states were classified as wake. The wake state thus encompassed states with high EMG power (active awake) or low delta power but without elevated EMGactivity or theta/delta ratio (quiet awake). 
- Finally, we manually verified the automatic classification to evaluate the results.
## Interactively visual scoring
During the whole processing, the GUI provide visualization and allow easily and interactively manual thresholding and scoring.
